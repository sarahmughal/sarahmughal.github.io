## hi, iâ€™m sarah! ðŸª»
welcome to my little corner of the internet! iâ€™m a masterâ€™s student in health data science at uc san francisco! as a biology graduate from uc riverside, iâ€™m obsessed with all things data + science (together and separate) ðŸ§¬

i use she/her pronouns. my curiosities wander toward diversity, equity & inclusion (i'm a current mrc work study intern at ucsf) and all things wellness + happiness ðŸŒ¿

most days youâ€™ll catch me with a salt & stone candle burning (santal + vetiver, always) while iâ€™m either scrolling through pinterest crafting a perfect board that encompasses the upcoming season (all the hex codes have to match) or reading the newest y/a book about a summer romance... with a dark twist, of course

## Contact
even as an introvert at heart, i love meeting new people! if youâ€™ve read this far, please say hi :) letâ€™s chat about anything from liquid biopsies to houseplants to one direction.
